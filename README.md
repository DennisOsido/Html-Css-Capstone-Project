## In this solo project I have: 

### Built Three pages, each with their own Desktop and Mobile version: 

- The Main Page
- The About Page
- The Tickets Page

### Each of these pages have versions for 2 different screen sizes: 

- mobile: up to 768px
- desktop: from 768px

### I did an extra effort and made the page responsive from 1920px all the way to 320px screen width.

### The colors, typographies, and layout of the original design were followed.

# What it does
It is an HTML page created using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

## Built With
- HTML5
